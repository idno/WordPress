WordPress for Known
================

This plugin provides POSSE support for [Known (idno)](https://github.com/idno/idno). It is considered **extremely beta** software and should not be used on production sites.

This plugin requires 2 WordPress plugins to be installed and activated on the site you are syndicating to: [JSON REST API (WP API)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/) and [Basic Auth](https://github.com/WP-API/Basic-Auth). WordPress will reportedly be integrating the JSON REST API plugin into core currently slated at the 4.1 release, which will no longer require external plugins to syndicate.

Installation
------------

* Clone into the IndoPlugins folder of your idno installation.
* Log into idno and go to Settings.
* Add Site URL, Username, and Password.
